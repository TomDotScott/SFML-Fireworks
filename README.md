# SFML Fireworks
A simple endless animation of representing fireworks in 2D made with C++ and the SFML graphics library. Each firework has basic physics behind it, with acceleration and veclocity values stored in `sf::Vector2f`. Each particle is affected by gravity and 'explodes' when reaching it's peak (defined by when it's velocity has gone below zero)
